This repository contains the data and code to study 3 research questions in degus across two study years.

1. Are key individuals present?
2. What individual attributes predict who is key?
3. What role do key individuals play within their social groups?

All analyses are performed in R and the code used is included in the 'code' folder. We numbered the Rmarkdowns to clarify which files to use first.
